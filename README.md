I have developed a fully functional e-commerce website using the MERN stack, featuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. The site includes the following key features:

Pages:

Shop: A central page displaying all available products.
Men, Women, Kids: Dedicated category pages for specific product types.
Authentication:

User Login and Registration: Secure user authentication system using JWT tokens.
Token-Based Access: Users can log in, and token-based authentication ensures secured access to the site.
Shopping Features:

Add to Cart: Users can add products to their cart.
Cart Updates: The cart updates in real-time based on the user's actions and is linked to their account.
Checkout: A smooth checkout process after adding products to the cart.
User Management:

Dynamic Cart Management: Cart items persist based on users' sessions, allowing them to modify quantities and remove products.
Responsive Design:

The website is 100% responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
Admin Panel :

The admin panel allows admins to add and delete products from the catalog, ensuring smooth product management.
This project integrates front-end technologies like React for a smooth user experience and back-end technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle data management and authentication.
